I am Rayhan Hossain, and I'm doing my MS in Computer Science. My research interest is to improve the performance of Compiler, Operating, and Runtime systems. I believe, this Digital Archeology course will assist me to gather some knowledge in data processing and data backing up in the efficient way.
