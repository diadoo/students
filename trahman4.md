I am Tasmia Rahman, a graduate student from Bangladesh. My current advisor is Dr. Michael Jantz and I have learnt a lot from him about compiler construction and performance optimization. Recently, I have developed interest in data analytics and data science. To explore more of this area, I have taken this course and I hope to learn details on data collection, data analysis and data repository stuff.
