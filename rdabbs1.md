I am Rosemary Dabbs. I have a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering from the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I started learning more about coding when I needed to analyze data for my bioscience research at ORNL which sparked my interest to pursue data science. I plan on applying for the Data Science and Engineering PhD program in the Spring. 

My hobbies include puzzles, boardgames, and hiking. I have two cats named Juniper and Charlie that like to step on my keyboard while I work.
